# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control lets us view all revisions made throughout the history of a file or multiple files, and allows us to merge revisions made by multiple people. This is useful when working on a project with a group of programmers. Each person can work on their own version of a file which can later be merged back into the master later.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a project you are working on. You would use a branch to add a new function or feature to a project. Using a branch would allow you to work on this addition without modifying the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in Git. A good commit message should be a very specific to what was done in the commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you try integrating a branch into the current working branch, and a conflict occurs due to conflicting changes made.
