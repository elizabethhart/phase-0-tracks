What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

The Linux OS assumes the user is computer literate, giving complete control. This makes it possible for a user to really screw up their system but it also allows a user to make something really cool. Linux is an open source software, meaning that it's the result of a community of users that help build and update the system, and it's free to anyone to download.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a virtual machine that is provided by a company that runs internet servers (like amazon) which allows the user to have a web-accessible piece of memory on a remote server that acts like it's own computer, with it's own operating system, without having to set up a physical server of your own.

The advantages of using VPS are that it is a stable and reliable place for web hosting, it allows the user more control than shared hosting (root access), it's eco-friendly, there is easy scalability if you have increased growth in web traffic, and it's more cost effective for small websites.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

It's a bad idea to run programs as the root user because it makes your system more vulnerable. The program you're running could have a bug or virus that could wipe out your files.
