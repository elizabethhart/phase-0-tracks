jquery gameplan:

00:00 - 00:30: Do a general google search about jquery, background info, etc.

00:30 - 01:00: Find online resources with examples of how to use jquery.

01:00 - 01:05: Take a quick break.

1:05 - 1:30: Watch a few youtube videos about jquery.

1:30 - 2:00: Test jquery out on my own.

The two most beneficial things during my search were the w3schools jquery overview and examples, and also youtube videos showing jquery commands and their effects in real time.
